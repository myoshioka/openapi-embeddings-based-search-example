# Sample of using OpenAI GPT API with embeddings

## Overview

- This repository is a sample code based on [openapi's examples pages](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb)
- The content is the same, but we have made it possible to search in Japanese by using data from the Japanese Wikipedia site.

## Description

- The Embedding dataset is created by retrieving data from the Japanese Wikipedia site. Please refer to the [Openapi site](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/793384ff3bfe30be9479e24ab93ec2a6b4fa9ff8/examples/Embedding_Wikipedia_articles_for_search.ipynb) for details.
